<h4>Art</h4>
<p>I never really knew how to appreciate art. Fixated gazes until the realm of existence engulfs every corner of the room? Silently, waiting for the eruption of astonishment? Crafting intricate stories so the reflection is recognizable to you? <br>
    While these thoughts remain unwavering, somehow feeling sympathy resurfaced ever so often.
    I would have hated being in their position. Center of attention with each person injecting and penetrating their emotions and sentiments into you and bearing the obligation of constant embracing and expressing.
